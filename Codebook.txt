You can download original data set from this url

I merged train and test set and labeled with activities
and aloso grouped by whole dataset by subject_id and acitiviy labels.

Among 561 vairables, 
I extracted 66 columns data whose column names contains mean() or std()

So, my tidy set code books are each column's mean  grouped by subject_id and activity labels.

subject_id: each id of subject get trained or tested
activity_nm: factor variables for acitivity of subject
other columns: mean( columns of every mean or std variables ) of each subject_id, acitivity_nm
