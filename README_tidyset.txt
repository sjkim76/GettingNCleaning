To make a tidy set for this course project

First of all, I read activity.txt for labeling each activities of subject

Second, I read features for naming column train,test set

Third, by Column binding and Row biding, I can get a whole data set

Fourth, I labeld activity as a factor

Fifth, I extracted column names with mean() and std() using regular expression.

Finally, I can get tidy set using group by mean based on subject_id, activity_nm
